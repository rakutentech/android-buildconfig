# Android Documention Theme for Github Pages

This is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages. It's intended to allow you to have published documentation for multiple versions of your library. The viewer of the docs will be able to select which version they wish to view.

## How to use

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

Create a new branch on Github called `gh-pages`, and then enable [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages) for your repo.

### 2. Add config

In your `gh-pages` branch, create a file named `_config.yml` with the following content:

```yml
plugins:
  - github-pages

remote_theme: rakutentech/android-sdkutils@gh-pages-theme

title: Your repo title
description: Description of your repo
repository: your-org-name/your-repo-name

#Optional:
docs_path: docs # Path where docs will be stored
api_docs_path: api # Path (within `docs` path) where API docs are stored

collections: 
  versions: # Folder name where versions are stored
```

### 3. Add versions

Create a folder named `_versions`. This folder should contain files representing your published versions. For example, for version `1.0`, you should have a file named `1.0.md` with the following contents:

```
---
version: 1.0
---
```

### 4. Add docs for versions

Create a folder named `docs` which will contain the published documentation. The folder structure should look something like this:

```
docs 
│
├── 1.0
│   ├── index.md  (Should have the 'userguide' layout applied)
│   │
│   └───api
│       └── index.md
│
└── 2.0
    │   index.md  (Should have the 'userguide' layout applied)
    │
    └── api
        └── index.md
```

Note that the files under `docs/VERSION_NAME/index.md` should have the `userguide` layout applied. This can be done by adding the following to the top of the markdown file.

```
---
layout: userguide
---

# The rest of your markdown content is here
```

### 5. Test locally

You can test locally by using Ruby's `bundle` command. First, you will need to create a file in the root of your pages site called `Gemfile`:

```
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "github-pages", "197", group: :jekyll_plugins
```

Next, run the following commands:

1. `bundle install`
2. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
